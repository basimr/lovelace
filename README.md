# Project Lovelace

[Project Lovelace](http://projectlovelace.net) is a bunch of free scientific programming problems. Each problem teaches you some science like how to simulate a guitar, splice DNA, or predict the weather, and requires the use of scientific insight and some programming skills to solve. The problems get progressively harder but the goal is to learn cool science through programming (or vice versa)!

This repository holds the website frontend HTML, CSS, and Django template code which was created using Bulma as well as the server backend code which uses the Django framework.
