    <h2>What is Project Lovelace?</h2>

                Project Lovelace is an open online platform for learning about science and
                developing computational thinking through programming and problem solving.
                It is a collection of computational science problems and tutorials taken
                from all branches of the natural, social, and mathematical sciences. Each
                problem teaches a scientific application (e.g. locating earthquakes, DNA
                splicing) and requires the use of scientific insight and some programming
                skills to solve. Tutorials teach computational methods that students and
                researchers may find useful (e.g. solving differential equations, Bayesian
                inference) and may be required knowledge for some problems.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                While Project Lovelace is still in development, we are deploying the
                website and the problems one by one throughout the winter. In addition to
                the website's recreational aspect we ultimately hope that the problems and
                tutorials may be used in undergraduate courses, especially to complement
                courses that lack a computational portion as computational methods have
                become ubiquitous in almost every field of science.
            </p>

                Lovelace draws inspiration from similar projects such as
                <a href="https://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank">Project Euler</a> and
                <a href="http://rosalind.info/" target="_blank">Rosalind</a>.
