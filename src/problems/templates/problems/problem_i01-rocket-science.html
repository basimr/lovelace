  <p class="has-text-justified">We'll get you familiar with how Project Lovelace problems work by doing some rocket science! A rocket, say the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-was-the-saturn-v-58.html">Saturn V</a>, needs to escape a planet with velocity $v$ but it needs to know how much fuel to carry with it for its escape. You can calculate the amount of fuel needed using the rocket equation $m_\mathrm{fuel} = M \left( e^{v/v_e} - 1\right)$ where $M = 250,000 \; \mathrm{kg}$ is the mass of the rocket (with no fuel), $v_e = 2,550 \; \mathrm{m/s}$ is the exhaust velocity of the rocket, and $e = 2.71828...$ is Euler's number. Your program or script should read in the velocity $v$ as an input, calculate the mass of fuel needed, and print it.</p>

{% block input_description %}
  The velocity $v$ the rocket needs to reach (in meters per second [m/s]) to escape the planet.

{% block output_description %}
    The mass of fuel $m_\mathrm{fuel}$ needed by the rocket to escape the planet in kilograms (kg).
