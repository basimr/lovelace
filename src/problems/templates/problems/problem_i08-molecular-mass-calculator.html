    <p>
        Molecules are made up of atoms and each atom has a specific mass. For example, water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is a molecule made up of two hydrogens and an oxygen. Atoms are so light that using grams to describe their mass can get pretty annoying so we use other units, like the atomic mass unit (amu), to do so. 1 amu is defined as one twelevth the mass of a carbon-12 atom, or $1.661 \times 10^{-27} \mathrm{kg}$. For example the lightest atom, the hydrogen (H) atom, has a mass of 1.008 amu while carbon (C) has a mass of 12.011 amu and the heaviest atom on the periodic table, Oganesson (Og), has a mass of 294 amu while the methane molecule (CH4) has a mass of 16.04 amu.

        Your program should read in a comma-separated file containing the abbreviation of the elements in the periodic table with their masses in atomic mass units (amu) along with an arbitrary chemical formula and print its molecular mass.
