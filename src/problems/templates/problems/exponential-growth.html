<p class="block has-text-justified">
  The laws of nature are often written down in terms of differential equations. Everything from the motion
  of a football to the quantum state of a particle and the global ocean circulation are described in terms
  of differential equations!
</p>

<p class="block has-text-justified">
  Some differential equations can be solved by hand but many interesting ones cannot, so numerical or computational
  solutions are super useful here. Here we'll solve a simple differential equation numerically. Technically we'll
  be solving a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) using the forward Euler method, the simplest
  numerical method for solving ODEs.
</p>

<p class="block has-text-justified">
  We want to solve the differential equation describing exponential growth

  $$ \frac{dx}{dt} = kx $$

  where $t$ is time, $k$ is a growth rate, and $x$ is the quantity we want to solve for (it could represent the
  number of bacteria in a petri dish or <a href="{% url 'problems:detail' 'compound-interest' %}">compound interest</a>).
  The differential equation is saying that the rate of change of $x$ is proportional to $x$ itself, so the more
  $x$ you have the faster $x$ will grow. We want to solve for $x(t)$ which will be a function of time $t$.

  To solve the differential equation we will discretize it numerically which will allow us to solve it
  iteratively. We will solve the equation at discrete times $t_0 = 0$, $t_1 = \Delta t$, and so on
  so the nth time step will be $t_n = n \Delta t$ where $\Delta t$ is a constant time step between solutions.
  Let's denote the current value of $x$ to be $x_n = x(n \Delta t)$. If we know $x_n$ then we want a formula
  for computing the next value $x_{n+1}$.
</p>

<p class="block has-text-justified">
  To find this formula, we start by discretizing the derivative

  $$ \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{x_{n+1} - x_n}{\Delta t} = kx_n $$

  where $\Delta x = x_{n+1} - x_n$ is the change in $x$ over the constant time step $\Delta t = t_{n+1} - t_n$.
  We can then solve for $x_{n+1}$ to get

  $$ x_{n+1} = x_n + k x_n \Delta t $$

  So if we start with an initial value $x_0$ and we know the growth rate $k$ and time step $\Delta t$ then
  we can compute the solution $x_1$, $x_2$, and so on which will be a numerical approximation to the real
  solution $x(t)$.
