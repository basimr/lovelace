    <p>
      * Mention that encrypted messages have been employed since antiquity (i.e. the invention of writing).
      * Cryptography is the study of X. Explain that ciphertexts are usually written in all caps and periods are left out.
      * Explain the Caesar cipher. Mention there are only 26 different ciphers for English.
      * It's a weak cipher and isn't used for anything serious today, but was used in Roman times.
