        An M198 howitzer situated on a flat surface fires an M107 shell of mass $m$ at an angle
        $\theta$ to the horizon. The projectile leaves the howitzer's barrel at the coordinates
        $(x_0, y_0)$ with initial velocity $v_0$. During it's flight it is subjected to a drag
        force acting in the opposite direction to its motion

        $$\mathbf{F}_d = -\frac{1}{2}C\rho Av^2\hat{\mathbf{v}} $$

        where $\rho$ is the density of the air, $C$ is the projectile's drag coefficient, $A$ is
        the projectile's area subject to the drag force, and $v$ is the projectile's velocity.
        $\hat{\mathbf{v}}$ is a unit vector in the direction of the projectile's velocity.
        Values for the constants are given below in the input section.

        What is the $x$-coordinate of the projectile's landing spot?
