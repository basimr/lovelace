  Simplest climate model

  Zero-dimensional energy balance model where we'll assume that the energy absorbed by the Earth is equal to the energy
  being radiated out by the Earth. We can actually calculate the Earth's temperature in this case.

  We can call this state <i>radiative equilibrium</i> where

  $$ \mathrm{Energy in} = \mathrm{Energy out} $$

  Rock star model because we're treating the planet as a very ideal floating rock in space without

  The solar power per unit area at the top of Earth's atmosphere is given by the Solar constant
  $S = 1361 \; \mathrm{W/m}^2$. The sun shines on half of the Earth at a time which corresponds to be a cross-sectional
  area of $\pi R^2$ where $R$ = 6371 km. And some fraction $a$ of that is reflected back to space, where $a$ is the
  albedo of the Earth. So the energy absorbed by the Earth from the Sun is

  $$ \mathrm{Energy in} = (1 - a) S \pi R^2 $$

  Treating the Earth as a blackbody it radiates energy out everywhere on its surface according to the Stefan-Boltzmann
  law $\sigma \varepsilon T^4$ where $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $\varepsilon$ is the emissivity of the
  Earth, and $T$ is the temperature of the Earth we want to solve for. To get the total energy radiated out by the Earth
  we multiply by the surface area of the Earth, $4\pi R^2$, to get

  $$ \mathrm{Energy out} = 4\pi R^2 \sigma \varepsilon T^4 $$

  We now get the following balance and can solve for $T$

  $$ (1 - a) S \pi R^2 = 4\pi R^2 \sigma \varepsilon T^4 \implies T = \sqrt[4]{\frac{(1 - a) S}{4\sigma\varepsilon}} $$
