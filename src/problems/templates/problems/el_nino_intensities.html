      * What is El Nino and the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)?
      * https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Marine/El-Nino#26072340-how-often-does-el-nio-occur-and-how-long-does-it-last
      * What is the Multivariable El Nino Index (MEI)?

      A warm (El Nino) event occurs when the MEI is at or above +0.5 for five consecutive two-month periods, and a cold (La Nina) event occurs when the MEI is at or below -0.5 for five consecutive two-month periods. The threshold is further broken down into weak (with a 0.5 to 0.9 anomaly), moderate (1.0 to 1.4), strong (1.5 to 1.9) and very strong (â‰¥ 2.0) events.
