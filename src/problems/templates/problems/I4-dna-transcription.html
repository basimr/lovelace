    <p>
        Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. This genetic information is stored as a sequence of nucleotides of which there are four: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). Thus a DNA sequence can be stored on a computer as a string of <tt>ATCG</tt> characters.

        Certain DNA sequences store the information required to syntheize proteins, and the first step is to transcribe the DNA sequence into a ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequence. The transcription process is biochemically complex, however the end result is that the RNA sequence is simple the DNA sequence with all instances of <tt>T</tt> replaced with a <tt>U</tt>.
