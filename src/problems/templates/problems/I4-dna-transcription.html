    <p>
        Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule found 

        A DNA sequence is a string of <tt>ATCG</tt> characters representing possible nucleotide
        bases of which there are four: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T).

        The complement of a DNA sequence is obtained by substituting each base with its base
        pair (<tt>A</tt> and <tt>T</tt> are one pair. <tt>C</tt> and <tt>G</tt> is the other).
        
        Together the two strands containing the sequence form a DNA molecule.
