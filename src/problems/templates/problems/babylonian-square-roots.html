<p class="has-text-justified">
  The square root of a number S is denoted $\sqrt{S}$ with the property that $\sqrt{S} \times \sqrt{S} = S$. It's easy
  to calculate for square numbers, like $3 \times 3 = 9$ so $\sqrt{9} = 3$. For other numbers it's not as easy but the
  ancient Babylonians seemed to know how to calculate them pretty accurately (see the figure and caption).

<p class="has-text-justified">
  We have no idea how they calculated square roots so accurately, but a method they might have used has been called the
  Babylonian method.

  The basic idea is to start with an initial guess $x_0$ for $\sqrt{S}$. Then we can keep improve on this guess: if
  our current guess, $x_n$, is an overestimate to $\sqrt{S}$ then $S/x_n$ will be an underestimate and vice versa, so
  averaging the two should produce a better guess:

  $$ x_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2} \left( x_n + \frac{S}{x_n} \right) $$

  We can use this formula to calculate better and better guesses. Given a number $S$, calculate and return its square
  root using the Babylonian method.

    A photograph of the Babylonian clay tablet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YBC_7289">YBC 7289</a>. The
    numbers on the diagonal are actually a pretty accurate approximation of $\sqrt{2}$. They read in sexagesimal
    (base 60) 1, 24, 51, and 10 which cooresponds to $\sqrt{2} \approx 1 + 24/60 + 51/60^2 + 10/60^3 = 1.41421296...$
    which is correct to six decimal digits! It also shows a square with sides of length 30 and diagonal of length
    $30 \sqrt{2} \approx 42 + 25/60 + 35/60^2$.

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The method we used here is also called Heron's method after the Hero of Alexandria who explicitly described it
        in 60 AD.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Babylonians did lots of other cool stuff that was way ahead of their time like
        <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6272/482">
          calculate Jupiterâ€™s position from the area under a time-velocity graph
        </a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
