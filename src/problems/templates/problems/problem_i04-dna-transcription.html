  <p class="has-text-justified">DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the molecule that carries the genetic information of all known living organisms (life on exoplanets might be totally different!). The genetic information is stored as a sequence of nucleotides of which there are four: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). So a DNA sequence can be stored on a computer as a string of <tt>ATCG</tt> characters.</p>
  <br>
  <p class="has-text-justified">Certain DNA sequences contain the information required to syntheize proteins, and the first step is to transcribe the DNA sequence into a ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequence. The transcription process is biochemically complex, however the end result is that the RNA sequence is simple: the DNA sequence with all instances of <tt>T</tt> replaced with a <tt>U</tt>.</p>
