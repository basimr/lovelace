      An exoplanet is a planet orbiting a star outside of our own solar system. We can now detect these planets and of course, we want to know if they can sustain life. A major factor is how far away the planet is from its host star. If it's too close to its star the planet would be too hot and cannot support life. Too far and it's too cold to support life. There is a sweet spot called the circumstellar habitable zone (CHZ) in which a planet's surface is just the right temperature to support liquid water: not too hot and not too cold.

      One simple definition is that the CHZ is a ring around the star with inner radius $r_i = \sqrt{\frac{L_\mathrm{star}}{0.54}}$ and outer radius $r_o = \sqrt{\frac{L_\mathrm{star}}{1.1}}$. The radii $r_i$ and $r_o$ are given in astronomical units (1 au is roughly the distance between the Sun and the Earth) and $L_\mathrm{star}$ is the star's luminosity as a multiple of the Sun's luminosity.

      Given a star's absolute luminosity $L_\mathrm{star}$ and the planet's distance from the star $r$, your program should print "too hot" if the planet is too close to the star, "too cold" if it's too far away from the star, and "just right" if its in the CHZ.
