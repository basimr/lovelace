  <p class="has-text-justified">
    Let's look at an example of chaos arising from simplicity in nature: the logistic map. It's a simplified model used to describe population sizes and can be written mathematically as $x_{n+1} = rx_n(1 - x_n)$ where $0 < r < 4$ is a parameter and $0 < x_n < 1$ represents the population size at time step $n$. Starting with an initial population size of $x_0 = 0.5$ and $r$ as an input parameter, return a list of the first 50 values of the logistic map $x_0, x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{49}, x_{50}$. You should see different behavior depending on the value of $r$, but we'll leave you to play around with it and we'll have more to say on the solution notes.
