<p class="has-text-justified">
  Chances are if you live in the tropics near the equator or on an island, the temperature doesn't change a huge amount
  between day and night and through the seasons.

<p class="has-text-justified">
  The average temperature tells us how warm or cold a place is, while the temperature standard deviation tells us how
  much the temperature varies. For a series of temperature observations $T_1, T_2, \dots, T_n$, the average temperature
  $\overline{T}$ is calculated as

  $$ \overline{T} = \frac{T_1 + T_2 + \cdots + T_n}{n} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n T_i $$

  which can then be used to calculated the temperature standard deviation $\sigma_T$ using

  $$ \sigma_T = \sqrt{\frac{(T_1 - \overline{T})^2 + (T_2 - \overline{T})^2 + \cdots + (T_n - \overline{T})^2}{n}}
              = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (T_i - \overline{T})^2} $$

    Saskatoon has warm summers and long cold winters so it has the lowest average temperature out of the five cities and
    the difference the summer and winter is huge so it also has the largest temperature variations. Baku is warmer than
    Saskatoon so it has a higher average temperature and the seasons aren't as extreme so it has smaller temperature
    variations. Khartoum is even warmer than Baku with even smaller variations although it gets cooler in July and
    August with the arrival of the moist south westerlies. Singapore has a tropical rainforest climate and small
    temperature variations. San Juan, being in the Southern Hemisphere, gets the opposite seasons.
