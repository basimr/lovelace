<p class="has-text-justified">
  DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the molecule that carries the genetic information of all known living organisms (life
  on exoplanets might be totally different!). The genetic information is stored as a sequence of nucleotides of which
  there are four: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). So a DNA sequence can be stored on a computer
  as a string of <tt>ATCG</tt> characters.
</p>
<br>
<p class="has-text-justified">
  Certain DNA sequences contain the information required to syntheize proteins, and the first step in the process is to
  transcribe the DNA sequence into a ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequence. The transcription process is biochemically
  complex, however the resulting RNA sequence is simple: it's equal to the DNA sequence with all instances of <tt>T</tt>
  replaced with a <tt>U</tt> (uracil).
</p>
<br>
<p class="has-text-justified">
  Given the DNA string as input, return the transcribed RNA string. Keep in mind that these sequences can be very long
  (the human genome is 3,088,286,401 characters or base pairs long!).

  <h3>Solution notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>There are lots of genes with cool names like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_hedgehog">Sonic
      hedgehog (SHH)</a> gene with a potential inhibitor called <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_hedgehog#Robotnikinin">Robotnikinin</a>!
    </li>
  </ul>
  {% endif %}

  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology">central dogma of molecular
      biology</a> is commonly stated as "DNA makes RNA and RNA makes protein" so we are looking at the first half of it
      here where DNA gets transcribed into RNA.
    <li>CrashCourse has an excellent YouTube series on biology with videos on <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kK2zwjRV0M">DNA Structure and Replication</a> and <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itsb2SqR-R0">DNA, Hot Pockets, &amp; The Longest Word Ever</a> which
      explains how DNA is transcribed to RNA in real life.
    </li>
    <li>The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research makes <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjPcT1uUZiE">molecular visualizations of DNA</a> (also in <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hk9jct2ozY">HD with creepy sound effects</a>!) which show in amazing
      detail how DNA is stored so compactly and how it's replicated and transcribed.
    </li>
    <li>The human body has around 10 trillion cells, each of which has 1.8 meters of DNA. If you could stretch out all
      that DNA it would be 18 billion kilometers long, enough to wrap around the Earth's equator 450,000 times or cover
      the distance from the Sun to Pluto once or twice (depending on Pluto's current distance)!
